Another feature of Mensagia’s plugin for WooCommerce is to be able to export your ecommerce users to Mensagia to create campaigns via SMS (for example, users who have made purchases in your store or abandoned a cart). You can perform the export by the roles of created users, such as 'Clients' or 'Store Managers', among others.

Thanks to the export of your users from WooCommerce to Mensagia you will be able to create incredible campaigns:

* Send promotions or communications to users who have not made purchases in your store within a certain time interval.
* Send promotions / communications to the users of your store who have spent more money on it in a certain time.
* Create promotions and reward users with more orders in a given time interval.
* And much more!

You can also automate the sending of these campaigns and send SMS depending on conditioners such as the total spent this month or the total number of orders, use [Smart Messaging campaigns](https://mensagia.com/docs/campanas-inteligentes/1018) to be performed automatically according to the criteria you choose.
